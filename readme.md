Tired of dragging and crashing missing @IBOutlets? Want to get rid of dozens of @IBoutlets cluttering your VCs? Want to be cool like the Androids and have type safe auto generated references? ðŸ˜Ž
Use this script that will automatically generate view outlets for you!

# Installation

1. Drag & Drop `Outletgen` to your project folder.
2. Add `"$SRCROOT/Outletgen"` to to your Run Scripts in Xcode.

I'll maybe add it to CocoaPods if y'all are nice enough :)

# Using

Just add a "Restoration ID" to your views in xibs/storyboards and Outletgen will auto generate code for you to use.
